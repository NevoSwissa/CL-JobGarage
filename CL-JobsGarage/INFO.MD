Thank you downloading CL-JobsGarage, the extanded version of CL-PoliceGarageV2 !

This script allows you to create garages for purchasing and renting vehicles and much more. To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Configuring the Garage Template

The garage template is located in the `config.lua` file. Here you can enable/disable features and configure settings such as job requirements and vehicle information. Each garage requires a unique name that can be used as the station/garage name.

2. Setting Up Vehicles

You can set up vehicles for purchase or rent in the `config.lua` file. For rentable vehicles, set the price per minute. You can also set the required rank and vehicle settings such as extras, liveries, and trunk items.

3. Setting Up Coordinates and Camera Information

In the `config.lua` file, you can set up the spawn coordinates for the vehicle, the preview spawn coordinates, the check radius, and the camera information for the preview. You can also choose whether to use a marker or a target as the garage interaction.

4. Adding a Blip and Target Ped

If you choose to use a target ped, you can set the ped model in the `config.lua` file. You can also add a blip to the garage by setting the blip ID, color, scale, and title.

5. Starting the Garage

Once you have configured the garage, start the script and enjoy!
